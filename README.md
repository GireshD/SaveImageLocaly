# SaveImageLocaly

Why save images locally?

There are many reasons for wanting to save images locally on a users device. You might want to save the images so that you do not need to download them again, or, you might be building an app that edits images. These are only a few of the reasons that you may want to save images locally.

We are going to build an app that allows us to save an image locally. We will be using UserDefaults and file system in order to save locally.
